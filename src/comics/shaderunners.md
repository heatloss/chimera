A thousand years ago, the last colour in the world faded to grey. Now, after a great archaeological discovery, it stands ready to enter the world again. Ironwell City will become the birthplace of a burgeoning new industry, where colour is pumped out of factories, poured into perfumed bottles and sold at exorbitant prices to those wealthy enough to afford it.

Now, in the city’s shadows, a group of ragtag bootleggers and bohemians band together to steal colour from the wealthy echelons of the city’s high society. Among them: a philosopher, a puppeteer, a gutter rat, an opera singer, a naval officer – and a hopeless romantic. Together, they run The Glass Dial, former watch shop and future speakeasy, where all the drinks run red.
