Tiger, Tiger is a story of a young noble lady, who steals her brother's identity and his ship to sail across the world to find love and adventure, and to write a book about her favourite subject: the fascinating life cycle of sea sponges!
This is definitely not a story for the faint hearted. There will be lots of romance, sword fighting nasty villains and exploring dangerous, uncharted lands.
