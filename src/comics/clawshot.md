Detective Charlotte Meyer switched departments to a new city-state in her mission to avenge her brother’s death and she gets partnered up with a boring withdrawn guy! James Knowles has had bad experiences with partners and just wants to be left alone doing desk work but Charlotte gets him wrapped up in her trouble after she sticks her nose where it doesn’t belong. How long will they be at each other’s throats before things get really heated?
