A handful of people mysteriously vanish at a comics convention, spirited away to the stars by a pair of bird-like aliens - who, apparently, are trying to save them. A massive, extraterrestrial spacecraft explodes in orbit, scattering advanced technology across the planet below. Otherworldly infiltrators walk the Earth, indistinguishable from humanity - but one of them has gone rogue, joining forces with a human investigator in pursuit of the truth.

In finding the common thread between these events, a motley collection of spacefaring outcasts is drawn together… and drawn into an ancient conflict that will change the fates of entire worlds.
