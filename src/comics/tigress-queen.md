Barbarian warlord Kizarasunga and pampered Prince Jintu meet face to face for the first time at the negotiation table to end a war that has been raging for decades. Tensions are already high when the Emperor proposes a marriage alliance that he’s certain could solve everything. Needless to say, it doesn’t go over well.

…Or does it?

While neither is interested in a political marriage, both this graceful scholar and ferocious warrior find more common ground than they expect. Is it possible for mortal enemies to join hands before scheming opportunists take advantage of the mounting uncertainty?
