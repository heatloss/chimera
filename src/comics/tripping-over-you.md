Milo Dunstan, an energetic theater kid, falls for his withdrawn classmate, Liam Schwartz.

Despite being unlikely friends, Milo and Liam strike up a mutual understanding of each other, as both feel like misfits in their London-based boarding school. Their friendship develops into a secret relationship that becomes difficult to hide.
