Thistle is a masked mage with a mysterious power, an enigmatic past, and, of course, the great burden of Destiny on her shoulders. 

Sheâ€™s chased out of every town with torches and pitchforks when the locals see her face, and is eagerly sought after by a great and terrible figure who defines most of her dark thoughts towards herself. In desperation, she briefly joins up with a small band of Mercenaries, but finds herself swept up in and caught off guard by their loyalty and acceptance. 

Who (or what) is Thistle? Where did she come from? Will these unruly, uncultured, rough-around-the-edge fighters be the ones to help Thistle realize her sense of self-worth in time to stop the shadows of her past from overwhelming and consuming the world?
