What are the little tiny things you enjoy, in your everyday life? What are the little tiny steps you take daily for a happier tomorrow? What are these little tiny critters crawling around your feet in the grass, so busy in their tasks?

Perhaps all these little tiny things aren't as insignificant as one would think.
