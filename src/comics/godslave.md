Godslave is about a girl thrown into the drama and danger of modern day Egyptian Mythology!

The story follows Edith after breaking a canopic jar open and finding-- an animal inside?? That's alive??? Even crazier, the animal claims to be Anubis and tasks her with retrieving his missing 8 Ba to return him back to his true form. She fights the monsters protecting his ba, and the rest of his divine family drama.
