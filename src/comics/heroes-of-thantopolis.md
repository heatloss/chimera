Heroes of Thantopolis is a fantasy action-adventure comic about Cyrus, a young boy who was transported to the titular City of the Dead under mysterious circumstances. The conniving queen of the realm, Helene, taps Cyrus as her Champion and enlists him to fight against three wicked ghosts interested in taking over the city, in exchange for sending Cyrus home and getting his memories back. Luckily, Cyrus doesn’t have to do it alone. Along with his new ghost friends, Cyrus explores the afterlife, fights bad guys and unravels mysteries. Can Cyrus save Thantopolis? And is it really that his arrival in the city was random? Or is there more to Cyrus than it seems…?
