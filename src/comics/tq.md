Barbarian warlord Kizarasunga and pampered Prince Jintu meet face to face for the first time at the negotiation table to end a war that has been raging for decades. Tensions are already high when the Emperor proposes a marriage alliance that he’s certain could solve everything. Needless to say, it doesn’t go over well.
