Bicycle Boy is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure comic by Jackarais.

Our protagonist--a cyborg who calls himself 'Poet'--cannot recall anything before the day he woke up in the middle of the desert, surrounded by corpses.

With no memories, no purpose and no idea what the hell is going on, he sets out to find answers.
