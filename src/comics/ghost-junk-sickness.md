Trigger Elliot is a bounty hunter who travels around the galaxy with his not-so-fully-licensed-and-technically-illegal-hunting-partner Vahn Gavotte. They’re lousy at what they do and often resort to petty tactics just to get a bounty, this is their life.

Their home planet, June 7, is a world rebuilding itself from an inexplicable catastrophic phenomenon that destroyed 75% of the planet’s surface. It has been 5 years since the destruction of June 7 and the planet now thrives on the transient and growing population of bounty hunters. Trigger and Vahn’s routine changes when a ambiguous huge bounty surfaces; an alleged bounty hunter killer named the ‘ghost’ with frightening abilities and an unknown motive. When Trigger’s past catches up with him, there begins a strain on his and Vahns hunting dynamic, forcing them to become further involved in chasing the elusive and unpredictable ghost.
