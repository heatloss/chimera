12-year-old Chandra (and her rich jewelry magnate aunt, Ajupris Lerazmine) have accidentally gone back in time. Now, they have one mission: to get their hands on the gigantic cache of the dangerous mineral that got them into this whole mess, chronotite, before it is officially discovered years in the future.

There's only one problem: the small moon where the chronotite is hidden is owned and operated by a corrupt galactic organization, A.I.D.E., and they'll have to pass the scrutiny of local administrator Mr. Demeck to get it. And even with knowledge of the future, there are some twists Chandra and her aunt can't predict.
