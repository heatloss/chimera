Katariina Lehto and Jousia Muotka are neighbors. They haven't talked to each other, until one day a mischievous cat leads Katariina into Jousia's apartment.

Katariina tells Jousia that she's a nurse, but not that she's on a sick leave because of burnout. Jousia tells her that he's a clairvoyant, but not that he's actually a witch. However, they find out about each other's secrets, and Jousia decides to help Katariina by introducing her to the many wondrous places behind a mysterious witch door.
