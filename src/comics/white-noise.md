When Hawk's brother Emry is killed and his half-sister Liya stolen away by otherworldly soldiers, Hawk is determined to find the only family he has left, no matter what it takes...even if that means crossing a country that wants creatures like him snuffed out.

Liya, meanwhile, finds herself alone on another planet populated by monsters. Full of grief over her lost brothers and anger at the enemy now surrounding her, she struggles to understand this new world she's been forced to take part in--and slowly begins to realize that all the things she thought she knew about it were wrong.
