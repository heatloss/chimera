In the early 1900s, the nation of Aetheri came out of its long interdimensional isolation and revealed to the humans of the Symphony Archipelago that they were not alone in the multiverse. Things swiftly got ugly after that.

In the early 1990s, Aetheri’s leadership changed, and in the Archipelago, a tiny broken family of half-siblings banded together in the face of the bile and hate that was boiling up between the humans and the non-humans.

In the early 2000s, that family was split apart. Hawk Press and his sister Liya Kiski both begin a long journey towards understanding the difference between friend and enemy–and between the family you’re given, and the family you make.
