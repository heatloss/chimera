### About the Chimera Comics Collective

Chimera is a collective of webcomic creators working across a monstrosity of different genres, styles and influences. Our aim is to lift the titles we catalog, provide a supportive community, and share resources among members to maximize everyone’s chances to succeed. Much like a chimera, we embody a multitude of characteristics and abilities. Romance, horror, adventure, YA or adult—we celebrate what makes us unique, while working as one to build a supportive comic community. We’ll be sharing resources, promotion and championing inclusivity and creativity.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**What does the collective do, exactly?**  
Our primary mission is to provide a community to our artists where we can support each other’s careers and lift up one another’s work. Our secondary goals, while still in their infancy, are to help strengthen the webcomic community as a whole, share resources, promote initiatives by other groups, and hopefully more as we go along.

**Is anyone getting paid here?**  
No. Everything we do—website, social media, sales—is 100% volunteer-based. All merch/book profits go to the individual artists. We would love to eventually build monetary support for this project, but that’s easier said than done. If the collective’s financial outlook ever evolves, we will of course be transparent about it.

**Who runs the social media accounts?**  
Our members generally take turns. There isn’t one person in charge.

**Is Chimera connected to Hiveworks Comics?**  
No. When Hiveworks shut down its publishing division, some of its artists decided to band together and start their own collective. That said, Chimera isn’t a publisher, and is not affiliated with the Hiveworks brand.

**Can I join?**  
Currently, membership is invite-only.

**What are the future plans for the collective?**  
As a newly formed collective, we’re focused on solidifying what we’re already doing: maintaining [social media](/contact/), improving this website and launching a [monthly newsletter](/contact/).
