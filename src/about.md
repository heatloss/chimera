### About the Chimera Comics Collective

Chimera Comics Collective is a collection of webcomics from creators across many different genres and tastes. 
Created by a group of artists, and for artists, the collective aims to lift the stories catalogued here to find readers and support for all of our hard work making webcomics.

The Collective aims to lift the titles in its catalogues, provide a supportive community, and share resources between members to maximize everyone's chances to succeed. Much like a chimera, we possess a multitude of characteristics and inclusivity. Whether you prefer romance, horror, or adventure, you will find it all with us â€” and maybe even things you weren't expecting!
